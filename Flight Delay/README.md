**Problem Selection**

```
Flight delays are worsening the situation. There are factors that are under the direct control of the carrier, 
such as aircraft turnarounds between flights, passenger punctuality, technical and crew performance etc. 
On the other hand, there are perhaps even more factors that are outside of the airlines control, security, airport conditions etc.
```

**Data Collection**

```
The main datasets used were the csv files taken from kaggle.com. Our datasets included the delay data of USA flight of one month with 
a fairly large amount of variables describing the reasons for the flight delay as well as the time period of the delay and information 
such as the delay occurred at which airport and through which airline.
```

**Presentation of Results**

```
Using the Tableau, we are able to draw some conclusion and interpretation on the effect of flight delay occurred by different airlines at 
different airport and found the various reasons for delay as well as suggest solutions to reduce those delays.
